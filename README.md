# material-design-react-to-sketch-demo

This Project has been built with `create-react-app`, `rmwc` (Google-endorsed Material Design react components), and `html-sketchapp-cli`.

This project contains official, Foundation-based Material Design React components which have been successfully rendered to Sketch using html-sketchapp-cli.

The built JSON files and final Sketch files are included here for reference :)




#
#### 1. Install project dependencies
(primarily create-react-app and rmwc, which included Google's official material-components-web):

`$ npm install`




#
#### 2. Install html-sketchapp

Install html-sketchapp. This project builds the plugin which you will install into your Sketch IDE.

`npm i @brainly/html-sketchapp`






#
#### 3. Install html-sketchapp-cli globally, which will output the json files you will apply using the Sketch "Almost Sketch to Sketch" plugin:
`$ npm install --global html-sketchapp-cli`


#
